# Chatbot
 This project is a Flask-based chatbot application that integrates Google’s Gemini AI model, a powerful, large multi-modal model trained for generating intelligent and responsive conversations. The application includes a user-friendly chat interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to interact with Gemini AI through a Flask server. To set up the project, simply install the required dependencies as listed in requirements.txt. If you encounter any version conflicts—especially with the protobuf package required by both mediapipe and google-generativeai—it’s recommended to use a virtual environment. Creating a virtual environment helps isolate dependencies, minimizing conflicts and ensuring compatibility across packages. You can create one using python -m venv venv, activating it with venv\Scripts\activate on Windows or source venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux. Once set up, run python app.py to start the server and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the Gemini-powered chatbot.
